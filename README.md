# Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon
Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results. 

## Introduction
Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows you to investigate data and make inferences based on your observations. A foundation in statistics also allows you to be a consumer of analyses that others perform, and allows you to relate to the conclusions others have drawn from their investigations.

## This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:

How to identify components of an experiment
How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results
